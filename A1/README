##Manual

// No details or assumptions have been made that were not included in the specification.
When the specification states "The floor should only cover on the NxN portion of the grid", this was 
assumed to mean that the floor takes up the same footprint as the NxN protion of the grid, but still
allows the grid itself to be visible

When the specification referes to the position (0,0) regarding the position of the avatar, this is 
assumed to be the top left corner of the grid (in the rotation it defaults to)

When the specification states "It should not be possible to shrink a bar below the ground plane." 
this is assumed to mean you cannot shrink the height of the cubes lower than 1.  i.e. they cannot
be flat squares.

No limit has been placed on bar height


All objectives have been completed.
