##Manual

When the specification states "The floor should only cover on the NxN portion of the grid", "cover" was 
assumed to mean that the floor takes up the same footprint as the NxN protion of the grid, but still
allows the grid itself to be visible on the floor.

When the specification referes to the position (0,0) regarding the position of the avatar, this is 
assumed to be the top left corner of the grid (in the view it defaults to).

When the specification states "It should not be possible to shrink a bar below the ground plane." 
this is assumed to mean you cannot shrink the height of the cubes to be exactly 0, thereby making 
the minimum height 1 (when the height is set to exactly 0, visible z-fighting occurs between the walls 
and floor making the walls appear partially "below" the ground plane).

No limit has been placed on bar height.

It is assumed that the reset button does not change/reset any colors.

It is assumed that when the reset button or R is pressed, the height of the maze is reset to 1.

When the specification states that the rotation "should persist independently of mouse movement, until 
the next button press.", "next button press" is assumed to mean the next LEFT MOUSE BUTTON press.

All objectives have been completed.
