##Compilation

As usual for the past assignments, in the root directory (Above "Project"), run "premake4 gmake" and then "make"
to build all the required libraries.

After this, go into Project and run "premake4 gmake && make config=release" there as well. This will build all the project code.

From here you can do the following sequence of commands to cd into a desired .lua file directory, render it, then
view the image:

cd Assets/demo_scenes/ && ./../../Project bvh2.lua  && cd ../..  && eog Assets/demo_scenes/images/output.png

In general, you can build and run any desired lua file with:

cd Assets/demo_scenes/ && ./../../Project bvh2.lua  && cd ../..  && eog Assets/demo_scenes/images/output.png

by replacing bvh2.lua with the desired lua script.

Currently only the lua scripts in the Project/Assets/demo_scenes/ are working. The above command will work 
for any lua file found there.

All of the previous commands are assumed to be starting in the Project directory.
The Project directory contains all of the content specific to this project, anything outside is either
past assignments or shared libraries!

I've included a file "sample_commands.txt" that provides example commands to start off with.

No other changes from the default premake4/make combination and assumptions.
