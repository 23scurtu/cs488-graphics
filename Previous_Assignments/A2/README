##Compilation

No changes from the default premake4/make combination and assumptions.
Completed on lab computer gl23.student.cs

##Manual

Added an extra status line indicating the field of view.

When in viewport mode, I assumed that the viewport only begins changing shape and "dynamically updating" once the 
mouse has begun dragging.  In other words, clicking on the spot without dragging will not make the viewport
dissapear.

No additional meaningful details or assumptions have been made that were not included in the specification.

All objectives have been completed.
